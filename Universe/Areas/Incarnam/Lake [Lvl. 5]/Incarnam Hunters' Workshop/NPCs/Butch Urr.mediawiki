{{dialog|text=I eat nice bloody beefsteak every morning. That puts me in a good mood for the whole day! ''grins so wide you can see 'his' meaty breakfast between his teeth.''
; Find out about the profession.
I hunt wild animals to feed the people. I'm skilled at turning Tofus into fritters and I can roast a leg of Gobball to perfection. Meat has to be cooked properly before you eat it, otherwise it's bad for the digestion.
; Find out more about the hunt.
You have to use the right weapon to avoid damaging the flesh. If the animal isn't killed properly, the hunter won't be able to harvest the good bits for cooking.
; Ask how you can find one of these weapons.
There's nothing better than a good hunting knife you've crafted yourself. When I need a new blade, I use the anvil in the Smiths' Workshop to make it.
; Ask how to cook meat.
You just need to gather the ingredients and combine them by following recipes. The workbenches needed to make tasty dishes can be found in the workshop.
; Thank her for this information.
