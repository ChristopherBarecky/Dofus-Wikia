{{dialog|text=They say that Shoemakers are always the worst shod. Twaddle! I am my biggest customer and my feet are perfectly protected. My boots give me heart and sole!
; Find out more about the Shoemaker profession.
Do you think adventurers would still be able to travel so far and wide without good shoes? And not to mention belts. How many red-faced heroes would be found with their pants down if a belt were to fail at a crucial moment? They certainly wouldn't be able to just turn the other cheek!
; Ask how to craft boots and belts.
Well, you go to a Shoemakers' workshop and use a tailoring bench of course! But before you go and make even a simple repair of sandals, obviously you need to have procured the right materials.
; Say thank you for this information.
