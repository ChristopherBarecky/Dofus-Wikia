==Talk==
{{dialog|text=You seem a little young to be venturing outside the temple. you ought to go back and see Master Joris, he probably has one or two things to teach you.
; Say that the Temple Master's name is Ganymede, not Joris.
Oh, right. The kid went back to the World of Twelve... I'll never forget his high-pitched singsongy voice and his habbit of saying hello to each and every new young soul. He was oddly endearing for a curtain twitcher! Who knows, maybe you'll run into him again?
; Leave.
