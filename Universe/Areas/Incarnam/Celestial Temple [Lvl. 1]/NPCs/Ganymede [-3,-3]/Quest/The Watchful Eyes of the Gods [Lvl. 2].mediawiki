{{dialog|text = You are very talented, [Character Name]! The ring you've made is perfect. Now you're equipped from head to toe. To test your effectiveness, a training session is a must!
; Say you have nothing against a bit of exercise.
I've notified Master Tarms, he's waiting for you in the Combat Room. Climb the stairs and show the gods what you can do!
; Head over to the arch of the Combat Room.

{{dialog|text=You're [Character Name], aren't you? I've been expecting you. Know that the gods are watching us... Are you brave enough to fight the horrible Spirtabbys?
; Reply that you're ready to prove your worth.

During your future adventures, you will often have to face several enemies at once. To complete your training, fight a Tigrimas and an Acrocat. Don't get taken in by their cute kitty looks, as their spirit fires could burn you.
; Approach one of the creatures to provoke it.
